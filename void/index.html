		<h1>The Void</h1>
		<p>
			The Void is a glitch area located outside any Animal Crossing New Leaf area, most commonly accessed by no-clipping in towns. This is an explanation of how it works.

		<h2>The Basics</h2>
		<p>
			Before I go into a big rant, I need to make sure you understand a few programming concepts. <b>Variables</b> (in this case) are like little boxes with numbers inside them. <b>Overflow</b> is when a number is too big or too small for a part of a program (or sometimes even the variable), and so when the variable is read, a certain amount is added to or taken away from it to make it an acceptable number. For example, if a program used a number between 0 and 9.9999999... and you gave it -1, it would add 10 to make 9, then use the number. If you gave it -101, it would add 10 to make -91, then add 10 to make -81, and so on. If you game it 26, it would take 10 to make 16, then take 10 to make 6. If you gave it 10, it would take 10 to make 0. You should now understand these basic terms. If not, find somewhere that explains it better.

		<h2>The Map</h2>
		<p>
			Ah. The map. Many Animal Crossing players might think I mean the <b>minimap</b> on the touchscreen, but I mean the entire area you are in. In the usual case of the Void, this means your town, but any area (the inside of a house, the island etc) actually counts. The position of you, and all other players, and all villagers, and even the train (collectively called <b>entities</b>) is stored in two variables, which I will call X and Y. Each entity has these. They refer to the map like this:<br><img src="http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/chap3_0672324989/elementLinks/03fig04.jpg"><br>As you can see, FINISH THIS wizzwizz4!
