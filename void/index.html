		<h1>The Void</h1>
		<p>
			The Void is a glitch area located outside any Animal Crossing New Leaf area, most commonly accessed by no-clipping in towns. This is an explanation of how it works.

		<h2>The Basics</h2>
		<p>
			Before I go into a big rant, I need to make sure you understand a few programming concepts. <b>Variables</b> (in this case) are like little boxes with numbers inside them. <b>Overflow</b> is when a number is too big or too small for a part of a program. It's a bit like a strip of see-through paper. The numbers are drawn on it like dots on a  number line. When a program reads the number, the paper is curled up in a loop, and when it looks at the loop, it sees a dot. This is fine if the loop is big enough, but if the loop is, say, 0 to 9, if 11 was on the strip, the two parts of the strip would overlap so when the program reads the dot, it would see through the top layer and read 1 (as if the dot was on the top layer). I see you aren't understanding this, so I will provide a link to a decent explanation.<br>

			You should now understand these basic terms. If not, google them.

		<h2>The Map</h2>
		<p>
			Ah. The map. Many Animal Crossing players might think I mean the <b>minimap</b> on the touchscreen, but I mean the entire area you are in. In the usual case of the Void, this means your town, but any area (the inside of a house, the island etc) actually counts. The position of you, and all other players, and all villagers, and even the train (collectively called <b>entities</b>) is stored in two variables, which I will call X and Y. Each entity has these. They refer to the map like this:<br><img src="http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/chap3_0672324989/elementLinks/03fig04.jpg"><br>As you can see, FINISH THIS wizzwizz4!
