        <h3>Explaination</h3>
        <p>This part makes a connection between one of your computer's 65536 ports (a road leading to YourComputerTown on Network Island) and one of the router's 65536 ports (a harbour on Network Island).
        <h3>Step 1:</h3>
        <p>
            Go to your router and read the label. Write the circled password down:<br />

        </p>
        <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://192.168.1.1/" target="_blank">Click here to access your router settings page.</a> This will only work if you are connected to the router (you are).
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3:</h3>
        <p>
            Type in the username <kbd>admin</kbd> and the password you wrote down in <b>Step 1</b>. Press Login. Scribble out the password you wrote down in <b>Step 1</b> (optional).
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4:</h3>
        <p>
            Press Windows Key + R to open Run, and paste in <kbd>control ncpa.cpl</kbd> and hit Enter. Right click on Ethernet, and click Properties. Don't change any check boxes, but select this:<br />

            then click Properties. If you see a dot in the circle beside "Obtain an ip address automatically", follow <a href="http://portforward.com/networking/static-ip-windows-8.htm">this</a> guide (skipping steps 5 to 8), and copy down the ip address you assign. If not, copy the ip address in the IP address box. Close everything you opened in this step.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 5:</h3>
        <p>
            Go back to the Router Settings Page you opened in <b>Step 2</b> and logged into in <b>Step 3</b>. Click the "Advanced" or "Advanced Settings" tab at the top.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 6:</h3>
        <p>
            Now click "NAT" in the menu on the left. Then click "Port Forwarding". This should bring up a new menu in the big space on the right.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 7:</h3>
        <p>
            In the first availible slot, fill in the following information:
            <ul>
                <li>LAN IP Address: Put in the final 2 digits of the IP address you wrote down in <b>Step 4</b></li>
                <li>Protocol Type: Select "TCP&UDP"</li>
                <li>LAN Port / Private Ports: Enter 25565 in the box(es)</li>
                <li>Public Port(s): Pick any number between 1024 and 65535 (NOT 25565 as a security precaution), and put it in the box(es). Also write it down.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Make sure you still have the IP address from <b>Step 4</b> and the Public Port from <b>Step 7</b>!</h4>
