        <h2>Part One: Let the server connect to the players</h2>

        <h3>Explaination</h3>
        <p>This part makes a connection between one of your computer's 65536 ports (a road leading to YourComputerTown on Network Island) and one of the router's 65536 ports (a harbour on Network Island).
        <h3>Step 1:</h3>
        <p>
            Go to your router and read the label. Write the circled password down:<br />
            <img src="http://ee.co.uk/content/dam/ee-help/e-gain.s3.amazonaws.com/external/content/Internet/Broadband/Images/Arcadyan2_030.gif" /><br />
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://192.168.1.1/" target="_blank">Click here to access your router settings page.</a> This will only work if you are connected to the router (you are).
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3:</h3>
        <p>
            Type in the username <kbd>admin</kbd> and the password you wrote down in <b>Step 1</b>. Press Login. Scribble out the password you wrote down in <b>Step 1</b> (optional).
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4:</h3>
        <p>
            Press Windows Key + R to open Run, and paste in <kbd>control ncpa.cpl</kbd> and hit Enter. Right click on Ethernet, and click Properties. Don't change any check boxes, but select this:<br />
            <img src="http://portforward.com/networking/windows-8-static-ip-address-lan-properties.jpg" /><br />
            then click Properties. If you see a dot in the circle beside "Obtain an ip address automatically", follow <a href="http://portforward.com/networking/static-ip-windows-8.htm">this</a> guide (skipping steps 5 to 8), and copy down the ip address you assign. If not, copy the ip address in the IP address box. Close everything you opened in this step.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 5:</h3>
        <p>
            Go back to the Router Settings Page you opened in <b>Step 2</b> and logged into in <b>Step 3</b>. Click the "Advanced" or "Advanced Settings" tab at the top.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 6:</h3>
        <p>
            Now click "NAT" in the menu on the left. Then click "Port Forwarding". This should bring up a new menu in the big space on the right.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 7:</h3>
        <p>

            In the first availible slot, fill in the following information:
            <ul>
                <li>LAN IP Address: Put in the final 2 digits of the IP address you wrote down in <b>Step 4</b></li>
                <li>Protocol Type: Select "TCP&amp;UDP"</li>
                <li>LAN Port / Private Ports: Enter 25565 in the/both box(es)</li>
                <li>Public Port(s): Pick any number between 49152 and 65535, and put it in the box(es). Also write it down.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Make sure you still have the IP address from <b>Step 4</b> and the Public Port from <b>Step 7</b>!</h4>
        <h2>Part Two:</h2>
        <h3>Explaination</h3>
        <p>Norton sets up a Firewall (Guards) on each and every port (road). This part will tell the Firewall (Guards) to let the server send and receive information on a particular road, like this Internet program is allowed to do. Otherwise, the players can't get onto the server!<br />As an added bonus, only the players from specific computers are allowed to even communicate with the server, so it's 100% Norton Safety Guarantee plus the Better Safe than Sorry technique!</p>
        <h3>Step 1:</h3>
            Open Norton Internet Security.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        <p>
            Click Settings.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3:</h3>
        <p>
            Under Quick Controls, check if Smart Firewall is on. If it is, click Firewall under Detailed Settings. If not, your Norton is not configured correctly and you might just've noticed a security breach in your computer!
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4:</h3>
        <p>
            In Firewall, click the Program Control tab, then press Add.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 5:</h3>
        <p>
            Scroll up so that you can see <kbd>Program Files</kbd> (not <kbd>Program Files (x86)</kbd>).
        </p>
        <h3>Step 6:</h3>
        <p>
            Open <kbd>Program Files</kbd>. Inside that, open <kbd>Java</kbd>. Inside that, open the folder starting with <kbd>jre</kbd> and a version number. Inside that, open the folder <kbd>bin</kbd>. Inside that, find and click on the program called <kbd>java</kbd>. Then click OK.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 7:</h3>
        <p>
            Change the setting <b>Options</b> to "Manual configure", then press Ok.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 8:</h3>
        <p>
            After a few seconds, the Add Rule windows should open. Choose Allow, then press Next.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 9:</h3>
        <p>
            Select Connections to and from other computers, then press "Only the computers and sites listed below". Add the ip addresses you've been emailed/texted, as well as the ip address <a href="http://whatsmyuseragent.com">this site</a> tells you and the range <kbd>192.168.1.0</kbd> to <kbd>192.168.1.255</kbd>. Ask the other players to text you the IP address that whatsmyuseragent.com gives them or they won't be able to connect.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 10:</h3>
        <p>
            Change the protocol to "TCP &amp; UDP", and the ports to "The rule will only appl...". Click Add, filter by "Individually Specified Ports", and change Locality to Local. Type in 25565, then press OK. Press Next.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 11:</h3>
        <p>
            Tick "Create a Security History log entry" and press Next.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 12:</h3>
        <p>
            Call the rule "Minecraft Server". Then press Finish.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 13:</h3>
        <p>
            Press "OK", "Done" or "Close" until there are no more Norton windows open.
        </p>
        <h2>Part Three: Creating a whitelist</h2>
        <h6>Credit to <a href="//youtu.be/T5_Q1fdhiks">TotalPlayable</a> for his video explaining the best way.</h6>
        <h3>Explaination</h3>
        <p>Minecraft has guards too! Blacklist means certain players are banned, and are kicked out if they try to go through the server gates. Whitelist means the server's gates are closed, and only certain players are allowed through.</p>
        <h3>Step 1:</h3>
        <p>
            Open Minecraft Server. It should be in a folder on your desktop.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        <p>
            Type in <kbd>whitelist on</kbd>.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3:</h3>
        <p>
            Type <kbd>whitelist add jeb_</kbd> to add <kbd>jeb_</kbd> (Jeb's account) to the server. Repeat with all usernames. Text to ask for them if you don't have them.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4:</h3>
        <p>
            Type <kbd>whitelist remove jeb_</kbd> to remove <kbd>jeb_</kbd> from the server. Repeat with all trolls.
